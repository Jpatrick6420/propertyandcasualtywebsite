I just paid, and cannot make another payment for auto insurance...`,
    reponse: `Ok, no problem! You just made your payment on [Regular Payment Date], which was [X days/weeks] ago, is that right?
Perfect. Let’s just wait until the [Regular Payment Date] and start your policy then instead of starting it now. That is what most people do, they wait until their normal payment date to start their policy.
I’ll make it very easy for you and schedule your first month’s payment to come out on the [Regular Payment Date], and that is when your coverage will begin with [Your Company].
So instead of [Current Insurer] charging you on the [Regular Payment Date], it’ll be [Your Company] that withdraws your first month’s payment on that day, and that is when your policy will begin with us. Does that make sense?`,
